# Truss-Builder
Generate small truss structures for bone tissue engineering with the software ABAQUS and then calculate the compliance matrix of the metamaterial. The goal is to automate an optimization for physical target values such as Young's Modulus.
The code is written in python.
This code is in a very early state.
